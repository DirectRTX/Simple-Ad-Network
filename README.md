# Simple Traffic Network
Simple Traffic Network is a free, open source PHP script to start your own traffic network.  This script is designed by the team at DirectRTX to allow anyone to start their own popunder network or media buying system.

Our #1 goal when developing this script was to allow anyone to start their own network for less than $10/month and make sure they never have to spend more than that until they're earning at least $5,000/day.  Seriously, you should be making at least $5000/day before you have to invest more than $10/month for hosting.

Please read the full documentation before setting up your own network.  If you've ever installed a script like WordPress - this will be just as easy.  But there's a lot of moving parts to make sure that your network can easily handle hundreds of millions of hits per day.  Below we'll walk you through every step of getting setup and explain how everything works.
